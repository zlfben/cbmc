This test checks that  members of typedef'd and dynamically allocated structs
are correctly havoced when enforcing loop invariants.
The assertion is expected to fail when `t->x` is correctly havoced (so would be
set to a nondet value).
However, it `t->x` is not havoced then it stays at value `0` and would satisfy
the assertion when the loop is replaced by a single nondet iteration.
