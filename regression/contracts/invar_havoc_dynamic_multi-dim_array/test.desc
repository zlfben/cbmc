Test case related to issue #6020: it checks that dynamically allocated multi
dimensional arrays are correctly havoced when enforcing invariant contracts.

The `__CPROVER_same_object(old_data123, &(data[1][2][3]))` assertion is expected
to pass -- we should not mistakenly havoc the allocations, just their values.
However, the `data[1][2][3] == 0` assertion is expected to fail since `data`
is havoced.

Blocked on issue #6021 -- alias analysis is imprecise and returns `unknown`.
