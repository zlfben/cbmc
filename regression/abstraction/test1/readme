Main.c has a simple while loop that compares a2 and a1. There are three specs:
1. spec.json gives all the related entities fully.
2. spec1.json just says abstract a1
3. spec2.json is malformed: it says abstract a1 and identifies a2_len as related.

May be split this into three different test directories?
